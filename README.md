## Tanks – Python / Pygame Arcade Shooter

**Tanks** is a sprite-based arcade shooter built in Python with Pygame. It evolved from my earlier ASCII project *Code Combat*, showing how game ideas scale from simple prototypes to full graphical games. 

### Features
- Sprite-based player tank and enemy units  
- Real-time movement, shooting, and collision detection  
- Enemy AI with basic pathfinding and attack patterns  
- Modular code structure demonstrating game loops, state management, and object-oriented design  
- Original visuals and music composed by me  

### Teaching / Learning Focus
This project illustrates how small, experimental game ideas can be expanded into a complete arcade experience. Perfect example for demonstrating:
- Transitioning from text-based prototypes to sprite-based games  
- Implementing game mechanics and AI  
- Organizing larger Python codebases with OOP principles
